The Collision avoidance file contains the team's efforts towards achieving the OpenCV object avoidance including all disparity, grayscaling, 
and other processing that was done to the video feed for image processing. The vehicle was expected to mover very slow so the average of 15FPS 
was acceptable for this use case. 
The "bones" of the avoidance algoritm are also included in the Python files.
The images represent the different actions that are being undertaken during image processing, and the video shows a test with good preliminary 
results for this avoidance system, however this test was performed while not attached to the drone.
