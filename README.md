# Heavy-Lift-Delivery-Drone-With-OpenCV-Object-Avoidance
This is an Electical/Computer Engineering Senior Capstone Project that was worked on in the fall of 2020 and spring of 2021 at Marshall University, Huntington, WV, USA. This project attemps to create a drone that is able to deliver an attached 10 lbs package to a gps destination autonomously, return to its original take off location, and avoid objects in flight with OpenCV.
